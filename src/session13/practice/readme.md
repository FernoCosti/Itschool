1.Char to Int Conversion: Write a program that prompts the user to enter a single character. Convert the character to its corresponding int value using the Character.getNumericValue() method. What happens if the character is not a numeric digit? How can you handle this scenario?

2.Floating Point Precision: Write a program that calculates the average of three floating-point numbers. What happens if the sum of the three numbers exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by a float? How can you handle this scenario?

3.Write a program that prompts the user to enter a day of the week and prints out a message indicating whether it is a weekday or a weekend day, using a switch statement.

4.Create a list of 7 random integers. Develop a program that identifies and prints the smallest and the largest numbers from the list.

5.Write a program that performs basic string compression by using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string "aaabbbcccaaa" would become "a3b3c3a3".
